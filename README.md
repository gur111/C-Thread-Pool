# About
This fork is utilizing C-Thread-Pool to make a client-server Cows&Bulls game.
The code is not written very well and does not follow naming schemes well enough in my opinion but it's a good example of a quicky project and a good first try of utilizing a thread pool in C.


# TODO
1. Add debug calls that are triggered only when debug flag is on
2. Go through all the malloc and validate ram allocation
3. Remove unused functions (most of them are located in thpool.c)
